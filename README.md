# nasa-epic-desktop-image
Windows app which sets latest NASA EPIC image as desktop background image. App was tested on Windows 10 but should probably work on Windows 8, 7, etc.

## Usage
You can use Task manager to repeatedly run this app (see https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-automate-windows-programs-on-a-schedule/). You need to provide your NASA API key as argument for the app. Instructions on how to achieve this is here https://superuser.com/a/285918.
